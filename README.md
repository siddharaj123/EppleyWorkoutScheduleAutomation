Description: Python automation project using Selenium to reserve a workout time at the Eppley Recreation Center. Used Xpaths to indicate most of the clicks for the selenium webdriver.

BackStory:
Since the start of COVID-19, only a few gyms have opened up. One such gym is the Eppley Recreation Center located inside the University of Maryland, College Park. However, to keep safety a priority, they have implemented a reservation system where students must reserve a time to workout. However, since the start of the fall semester, the reservations have been filling up very quickly, and I often times forget to reserve a time. To solve this, and to learn a little bit more about the Python package: selenium, I created this simple program to automate the reservation system so it would automatically reserve the earliest workout time for me once it became available
